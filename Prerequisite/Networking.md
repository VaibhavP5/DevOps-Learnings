# Computer Network: A Complete Guide

## What is Network?
**A system of interconnected devices or nodes that communicate with each other to transmit and share information.**

## What is Computer Network?
- **A computer network is a system that connects two or more devices like computers, servers, printers, routers, and switches.**
- **This connection allows these devices, called nodes, to communicate, share data, and use resources together.** 
- **They are linked by either physical cables or wireless connections and use standard rules, known as protocols, to ensure that information is sent and received efficiently.**

## Basics Components of Computer Network

## 1. NIC
- **NIC stand for Network Interface Card.**

- **NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer with another computer onto a network**

- **Each NIC is assigned a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address that identifies it on the network.**

- **The PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory) is where the MAC address can be stored, ensuring it remains unchanged and is used by the device to communicate over the network.**

## 2. Hub
- **A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple computers or network segments, enabling communication among them.**

- **When computer requests for some information from a network, it first sends the request to the Hub through cable. Hub will broadcast this request to the entire network. All the devices will check whether the request belongs to them or not. If not, the request will be dropped.**

- **The process used by the Hub consumes more bandwidth and limits the amount of communication.**

## 3. Switch
- **A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and uses MAC addresses to forward data only to the specific device for which it is intended.**

- **Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, enabling them to intelligently direct data packets based on the destination MAC address.**

- **Unlike hubs, which broadcast data to all connected devices, switches send data only to the intended recipient, reducing network congestion and improving efficiency.**

## 4. Router
- **A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks, directing traffic on the Internet and local networks.**

- **Routers operate primarily at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.**

- **Routers receive incoming data packets, analyze their destination IP addresses, and forward them to the appropriate outgoing network interface.**

- **Many routers perform Network Address Translation (NAT), allowing multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address when accessing the Internet, enhancing security and conserving IP addresses.**
